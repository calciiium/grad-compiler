I implemented both into SSA and out of SSA functionalities, in which the into SSA uses the dominance frontiers based version. I encoutered two major difficulties. The first is I found out some complicated benchmark tests failed and the problem eventually traced back to l5's dominator/dominance tree, implying l5 has some serious hidden bugs. The second is I'm not sure if it's caused by an incorrect setup, but my interpreter brili doesn't seem to accept 'undef' as an value (or that's intentionally designed?) To get around with this, I substitute all undef int type variable to const 0, and undef bool type variable to const true. In this way, the implementation can successfully passed is_ssa tests, and a partial part of benchmark tests. 
The overhead is huge (2x+). I think it can probably be improved by running other optimization, such as LCV and DCE, as some get and set are not used during the execution.
