This is a simple llvm pass that inverts branches if the second branch has a larger size than the first one. I was wondering how could this affect the execution time of the compiled code. So I tested on a cpp program that has a huge difference in its two branches. The result is kind of expected, probably because of the built-in optimization llvm has, there aren't a noticable difference in execution time regardless of inverting the branch or not.
